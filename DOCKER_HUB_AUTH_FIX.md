# Docker Hub Authentication Fix

## Problem
Docker Hub began requiring authentication even for public image pulls in certain environments, causing builds to fail with:
```
ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: python:3.12-slim: failed to resolve source metadata for docker.io/library/python:3.12-slim: unexpected status from HEAD request to https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/library/python/manifests/3.12-slim: 401 Unauthorized
```

## Solution
Switched from Docker Hub to Amazon ECR Public Registry which provides the same official images without authentication requirements.

### Changes Made
- **Dockerfile**: Updated base image from `python:3.12-slim` to `public.ecr.aws/docker/library/python:3.12-slim`
- **Dockerfile.fixed**: Updated base image from `python:3.12-slim` to `public.ecr.aws/docker/library/python:3.12-slim`

### Benefits
1. **No Authentication Required**: Amazon ECR Public Registry allows anonymous pulls
2. **Same Base Image**: Uses the exact same official Python Docker image
3. **Reliability**: ECR Public has excellent uptime and performance
4. **No Breaking Changes**: Application functionality remains identical

### Verification
Both Dockerfiles now build successfully:
- `docker build -f Dockerfile.fixed -t stocks-app .` ✅
- `docker compose build` ✅

### Alternative Registries
If ECR Public becomes unavailable, other alternatives include:
- `quay.io/python/python:3.12-slim` (Quay.io)
- `gcr.io/distroless/python3` (Google Container Registry)
- Building from source using `debian:bookworm-slim` base

This fix resolves the authentication issue while maintaining compatibility with all existing workflows.
