# Robinhood Stock Data Fetcher

A Python script that fetches comprehensive stock data from Robinhood for a list of tickers stored in an Excel file, then writes the results back to the Excel file with additional stock information.

## Features

- Fetches comprehensive stock data using the Robinhood API including:
  - Current stock price
  - 52-week high and low
  - Market capitalization 
  - P/E ratio
  - **Technical Analysis Levels (NEW!):**
    - **Pivot Point Support & Resistance**: Calculated using daily high, low, close prices
    - **Recent Support & Resistance**: Based on recent price action analysis over 20-day lookback period
- Reads ticker symbols from Excel file
- Writes results back to Excel file with new columns
- Supports Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Configurable credentials via environment variables or script modification
- Error handling for invalid tickers or API issues with 'N/A' fallback values
- Uses openpyxl engine for Excel operations
- Clean, formatted console output and Excel results

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Robinhood account
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Setup

### Method 1: Environment Variables (Recommended)
```bash
export ROBINHOOD_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
export ROBINHOOD_PASSWORD=your_password
export ROBINHOOD_MFA=123456  # Optional: For non-interactive MFA (useful for deployment)
```

**Note**: For Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), you can either:
- Set `ROBINHOOD_MFA` environment variable for non-interactive mode (useful for headless deployments)
- Leave it unset to be prompted interactively for the MFA code (only in interactive environments)
- In headless environments (Docker, Railway, CI), the application will automatically skip MFA prompts and proceed without MFA if the environment variable is not set

### Method 2: Configuration File
1. Copy the example configuration:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.py config.py
   ```
2. Edit `config.py` with your credentials

### Method 3: Direct Script Modification
Edit the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` variables at the top of `stock_prices.py`

## Prepare Your Ticker List

The script reads ticker symbols from an Excel file named `tickers.xlsx` (configurable). The file must have a column named 'Ticker'.

A sample file (`sample_tickers.xlsx`) is included with popular stocks: AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, TSLA, AMZN, META, NVDA, NFLX

To create your own:
1. Create an Excel file with a 'Ticker' column  
2. List your desired stock symbols (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL)
3. Save as `tickers.xlsx` or update the `TICKERS_FILE` variable

You can also start by copying `sample_tickers.xlsx` to `tickers.xlsx` and modify it as needed.

After running the script, the Excel file will be updated with additional columns:
- **Price**: Current stock price
- **52w_High**: 52-week high price
- **52w_Low**: 52-week low price  
- **MarketCap**: Market capitalization
- **PE_Ratio**: Price-to-earnings ratio
- **Pivot_Support_1**: Primary pivot-based support level
- **Pivot_Support_2**: Secondary pivot-based support level
- **Pivot_Resistance_1**: Primary pivot-based resistance level
- **Pivot_Resistance_2**: Secondary pivot-based resistance level
- **Recent_Support**: Recent support level based on 20-day price action
- **Recent_Resistance**: Recent resistance level based on 20-day price action
- **Risk_Reward_Ratio**: Risk/reward ratio based on support/resistance levels
- **Distance_from_52w_High_Pct**: Percentage distance from 52-week high
- **Distance_from_52w_Low_Pct**: Percentage distance from 52-week low
- **Upside_Potential_Pct**: Upside potential percentage based on pivot resistance
- **Downside_Risk_Pct**: Downside risk percentage based on pivot support
- **PEG_Ratio**: Price/Earnings to Growth ratio (currently N/A - requires growth data)
- **Valuation_Flag**: Valuation assessment (Undervalued/Fair Value/Overvalued)
- **Entry_Opportunity_Flag**: Entry opportunity assessment (Favorable/Neutral/Unfavorable)
- **Price_Level_Flag**: Price level assessment (Near Top/Mid Range/Near Bottom)

## Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python stock_prices.py
```

The script will:
1. Prompt for your Robinhood credentials (if not set via environment variables)
2. Ask for MFA code if you have two-factor authentication enabled
3. Load ticker symbols from the Excel file
4. Fetch comprehensive stock data for each ticker (price, 52w high/low, market cap, P/E ratio)
5. **Calculate technical support and resistance levels using historical price data**
6. Write results back to the Excel file with new columns
7. Display formatted summary of results including technical levels

## Logging Configuration

The application now uses a comprehensive logging system with configurable levels and rotating logs.

### Environment Variables

- **`LOG_LEVEL`**: Set the logging verbosity level (default: `INFO`)
  - `DEBUG`: Most detailed logging (includes all messages)
  - `INFO`: General information messages (recommended)
  - `WARNING`: Warning messages and above
  - `ERROR`: Error messages only
  - `CRITICAL`: Critical errors only

### Examples

```bash
# Run with debug logging
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python stock_prices.py

# Run with minimal logging (errors only)
LOG_LEVEL=ERROR python stock_prices.py

# Default (INFO level)
python stock_prices.py
```

### Log Features

- **Console Logging**: All log messages are displayed in the console with timestamps
- **File Logging**: Automatic log files with rotation (10MB max, 5 backup files)
- **Web Logs**: For web server mode, logs are captured and available via `/logs` endpoint
- **Rotating Buffer**: Web logs use a rotating buffer (1000 lines max) to prevent memory issues
- **Structured Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - module - LEVEL - message`

### Web Server Logging

When running in web server mode, additional logging features are available:

- **`GET /logs`**: View captured application logs with automatic rotation
- **Real-time capture**: All application logs are captured and made available through the web interface
- **Memory efficient**: Uses rotating buffer to limit memory usage

*Note: This table shows a subset of columns. The full Excel output includes all technical analysis columns (support/resistance levels), financial metrics (upside/downside potential), and assessment flags.*

## Technical Analysis

The script now includes comprehensive technical analysis to identify support and resistance levels:

### Pivot Point Analysis
- **Pivot Point**: Calculated as (High + Low + Close) / 3 using the most recent trading day
- **Support Levels**: 
  - Support 1 = (2 √ó Pivot Point) - High
  - Support 2 = Pivot Point - (High - Low)
- **Resistance Levels**:
  - Resistance 1 = (2 √ó Pivot Point) - Low  
  - Resistance 2 = Pivot Point + (High - Low)

### Recent Price Action Analysis
- Analyzes the last 20 trading days of price data
- Identifies key support and resistance levels based on recent highs and lows
- Provides additional confirmation for trading decisions

### Data Requirements
- Uses 3 months of daily historical data for calculations
- Handles missing or insufficient data gracefully with 'N/A' values
- All calculations are performed using Robinhood's historical price data

## Railway Deployment

This repository supports deployment on Railway in two modes:

### Web Service Mode (Default)
For platforms expecting an HTTP server, the application automatically runs as a web service with the following endpoints:
- `GET /` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /run` - Trigger stock data fetching job  
- `GET /status` - Get current job status
- `GET /logs` - View last job output
- `GET /favicon.ico` - Favicon handler

### Worker Service Mode
For background processing without HTTP endpoints, set `WEB_MODE=false`.

### Quick Deploy to Railway

1. **Deploy with Railway CLI** (recommended):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   railway login
   railway init
   railway up
   ```

2. **Deploy via GitHub Integration**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
   - Railway will automatically detect the `Dockerfile`
   - The service will automatically run as a **Web Service** (recommended)
   - Or set `WEB_MODE=false` to run as a **Worker Service**

### Required Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in your Railway project:

- `ROBINHOOD_USERNAME`: Your Robinhood email/username
- `ROBINHOOD_PASSWORD`: Your Robinhood password  
- `ROBINHOOD_MFA`: (Optional) Your MFA code for non-interactive login
- `TICKERS_FILE`: Set to `tickers.xlsx` if keeping the Excel file in the repository
- `WEB_MODE`: Set to `false` for worker mode, or `true` (default) for web service mode
- `PORT`: (Auto-set by Railway) Port for the web service

### Database Storage (Optional)

If you need persistent storage for the `tickers.xlsx` file:

1. Add a database service to your Railway project (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
2. Use the provided database environment variables to connect
3. Modify the application to store ticker data in the database instead of Excel

### Railway Configuration Files

- `Dockerfile`: Containerizes the application for Railway
- `railway.toml`: Railway configuration to ensure correct Python/Docker deployment
- `Procfile`: Legacy worker configuration (`worker: python stock_prices.py`) 
- `main.py`: Auto-detects deployment mode (web service vs worker)
- `web_server.py`: Flask web server for HTTP endpoints
- `wsgi.py`: WSGI entry point for production deployment

### Deployment Modes

**Web Service Mode (Recommended)**:
- Provides HTTP endpoints for health checks and job triggering
- Automatically uses gunicorn for production deployment
- Fixes 502 Bad Gateway errors on platforms expecting HTTP services
- Default when `WEB_MODE` is not set or set to `true`

**Worker Service Mode**:
- Runs the stock fetching script once and exits
- Set `WEB_MODE=false` for this mode
- Suitable for scheduled jobs or batch processing

## Security Notes

- Never commit your actual credentials to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Consider using a `.env` file with python-dotenv for local development
- Always log out when finished to maintain security

## Troubleshooting

1. **Login Issues**: Ensure your credentials are correct and MFA code is entered if prompted
2. **Missing Tickers**: Check that your Excel file has a 'Ticker' column with valid stock symbols
3. **API Errors**: Some tickers might not be available through Robinhood's API
4. **Rate Limiting**: If fetching many tickers, you might encounter rate limits
5. **Container Hanging on MFA**: In headless environments (Docker, Railway, CI), the application automatically detects the environment and skips interactive MFA prompts. Set `ROBINHOOD_MFA` environment variable if MFA is required.
6. **502 Bad Gateway Errors**: If you encounter 502 errors:
   - Ensure the application is deployed as a **Web Service**, not a Worker Service
   - Verify that `WEB_MODE` is set to `true` (or not set, as this is the default)
   - Check that the `PORT` environment variable is properly set by your deployment platform
   - The application now includes a web server that responds to health checks at `/`
