## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Robinhood account
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Setup

### Method 1: Environment Variables (Recommended)
```bash
export ROBINHOOD_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
export ROBINHOOD_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### Method 2: Configuration File
1. Copy the example configuration:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.py config.py
   ```
2. Edit `config.py` with your credentials

### Method 3: Direct Script Modification
Edit the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` variables at the top of `stock_prices.py`

## Prepare Your Ticker List

The script reads ticker symbols from an Excel file named `tickers.xlsx` (configurable). The file must have a column named 'Ticker'.

A sample file is included with popular stocks: AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, TSLA, AMZN, META, NVDA, NFLX

To create your own:
1. Create an Excel file with a 'Ticker' column
2. List your desired stock symbols (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL)
3. Save as `tickers.xlsx` or update the `TICKERS_FILE` variable

After running the script, the Excel file will be updated with additional columns:
- **Price**: Current stock price
- **52w_High**: 52-week high price
- **52w_Low**: 52-week low price  
- **MarketCap**: Market capitalization
- **PE_Ratio**: Price-to-earnings ratio
- **Pivot_Support_1**: Primary pivot-based support level
- **Pivot_Support_2**: Secondary pivot-based support level
- **Pivot_Resistance_1**: Primary pivot-based resistance level
- **Pivot_Resistance_2**: Secondary pivot-based resistance level
- **Recent_Support**: Recent support level based on 20-day price action
- **Recent_Resistance**: Recent resistance level based on 20-day price action

## Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python stock_prices.py
```

The script will:
1. Prompt for your Robinhood credentials (if not set via environment variables)
2. Ask for MFA code if you have two-factor authentication enabled
3. Load ticker symbols from the Excel file
4. Fetch comprehensive stock data for each ticker (price, 52w high/low, market cap, P/E ratio)
5. **Calculate technical support and resistance levels using historical price data**
6. Write results back to the Excel file with new columns
7. Display formatted summary of results including technical levels

The Excel file (`tickers.xlsx`) will be updated with new columns containing the fetched data:

| Ticker | Price  | 52w_High | 52w_Low | MarketCap      | PE_Ratio | Pivot_Support_1 | Pivot_Resistance_1 | Recent_Support | Recent_Resistance |

## Technical Analysis

The script now includes comprehensive technical analysis to identify support and resistance levels:

### Pivot Point Analysis
- **Pivot Point**: Calculated as (High + Low + Close) / 3 using the most recent trading day
- **Support Levels**: 
  - Support 1 = (2 √ó Pivot Point) - High
  - Support 2 = Pivot Point - (High - Low)
- **Resistance Levels**:
  - Resistance 1 = (2 √ó Pivot Point) - Low  
  - Resistance 2 = Pivot Point + (High - Low)

### Recent Price Action Analysis
- Analyzes the last 20 trading days of price data
- Identifies key support and resistance levels based on recent highs and lows
- Provides additional confirmation for trading decisions

### Data Requirements
- Uses 3 months of daily historical data for calculations
- Handles missing or insufficient data gracefully with 'N/A' values
- All calculations are performed using Robinhood's historical price data

## Security Notes

- Never commit your actual credentials to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Consider using a `.env` file with python-dotenv for local development
- Always log out when finished to maintain security

## Troubleshooting

1. **Login Issues**: Ensure your credentials are correct and MFA code is entered if prompted
2. **Missing Tickers**: Check that your Excel file has a 'Ticker' column with valid stock symbols
3. **API Errors**: Some tickers might not be available through Robinhood's API
4. **Rate Limiting**: If fetching many tickers, you might encounter rate limits
