# 502 Error Fix Demonstration

## Before the Fix
When deployed as a web service, the application would return:
```
GET / 502 21ms
GET /favicon.ico 502 1ms
```

This happened because the application was a command-line script that ran once and exited, leaving no HTTP server to handle incoming requests.

## After the Fix
The application now includes a web server that responds properly:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/
```

Returns:
```json
{
    "status": "healthy",
    "service": "Stock Data Fetcher",
    "timestamp": "2025-09-23T02:55:47.821751",
    "job_status": {
        "status": "ready",
        "last_error": null,
        "last_run": null,
        "run_count": 0
    }
}
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/favicon.ico
```

Returns: `204 No Content` (instead of 502 Bad Gateway)

## Available Endpoints
- `GET /` - Health check
- `GET /run` - Trigger stock data fetching
- `GET /status` - Job status
- `GET /logs` - View last job output
- `GET /favicon.ico` - Favicon handler

## Deployment Modes
- **Web Service Mode** (default): Runs HTTP server with endpoints
- **Worker Mode**: Set `WEB_MODE=false` for background processing only
